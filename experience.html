	<center><h3>My Experience When I Was Trips at Langkawi</h3></center>

	<p>There are a lot of things I will always remember, such as first day at primary school, holidays abroad and birthday parties. These special moments are all linked up with some celebrations or turning points in my life. Last 2 years ago, my family and i was visited Langkawi Island at Kedah. I am very excited to go there because i never been there before this. From the beginning, We reached at there by take a ferry in Kuala Kedah to their jetty In Kuah</p>
	</p><br>


	<p>The drive to Kuah was enjoyable as the roads were not congested. We went into relax mode straight away.mThere is no public transport on Langkawi so you have a choice of either renting a car or motorbike or take a taxi. Unfortunately we forgot to bring our driver’s licences with us so could not rent a car, instead we hired a tax for 6 hours which cost us 175MYR…..it would have been cheaper to rent a car for two days ….apparently you can rent a car for 50MYR per day.</p><br>


	<p>Our trip around the island was very enjoyable. We saw green jungle/rain forest and the odd rice paddy. The roads were in good condition also. We stopped at Perdana Galleria which is the most incredible building and it houses all the gifts given to Dr Matihir when he was Prime Minister. You could spend many hours here and it is amazing what he was given, including a Formula 1 racing car as well as many other cars. Next stop was Tanjung Rhu which is a beautiful beach at the north eastern tip of the island. We did not eat here but there were a lot of eateries and many day trips out on the water if that is what you would like to do. Very, very peaceful.<p><br>


	<p>Next we went to the Cable Car on the way back down the west coast. This is a great attraction and we had been eager to try it. Unfortunately it was raining so they closed it! Very disappointed but we wouldn’t have been able to see anything because of the clouds. We will just have to go back to Langkawi another time! The cable car ride can be taken from an area they have made into a little village with shops and eateries. Too may people around because it was school holidays so we decided not eat here.<p><br>


	<p>We were very hungry so ate at a little restaurant on the southern end of the beach. The food was delicious and very cheap. We walked the beach and also looked at the shops and ended up at the Cenang Walk which is at the front of the Cenang Mall. We ordered a corn chip salsa type snack. This was 8 corn chips with salsa and melted cheese….very yummy and excellent value for 4.5MYR. People started arriving at the restaurant and it was becoming quite a party atmosphere so being our last night in Langkawi we decided to have dinner here. What a great decision…the prawns I had were in a tempura batter and so light they could have floated away. Feeling relaxed and fed we caught a taxi back to Kuah and packed our bags. We think we will revisit Langkawi, perhaps for an extended period next time.</p>
